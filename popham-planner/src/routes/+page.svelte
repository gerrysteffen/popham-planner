<script lang="ts">
  import TitleBar from "$lib/components/basicUI/TitleBar.svelte";

<TitleBar title='Welcome' />
<div>Meals & Restaurants available below</div>
<div>Great user experience! You like!</div>
<div>For this page I was thinking maybe newly added Restaurants and Meals?</div>
<div>Or maybe some kind of stats?</div>
<div>Let me know if you have ideas</div>
